# @expo/build-tools

`@expo/build-tools` is the core library for the Turtle v2 project. It enables [Turtle Worker](https://github.com/expo/turtle-v2/tree/master/src/services/worker) to actually build React Native projects. It should be open-sourced in the future (along with some lightweight CLI tool).

## Development

`yarn` + `yarn watch`
